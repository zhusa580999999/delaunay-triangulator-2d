We use CMake to build this project.

You may download it from:
http://www.cmake.org/HTML/Download.html

To compile without littering your source directory, you
should perform an out-of-source build:

cd build
cmake ../src
make

To declare CMake compile targets, you would need to edit the
CMakeLists.txt file in the directory where your source file resides.
