BUILD
=====

Once you have everything above installed, you can build this project.

To compile without littering your source directory, you
should perform an out-of-source build:

cd build
cmake ../src
make


Unit Testing
============

To declare CMake compile targets, you would need to edit the
CMakeLists.txt file in the directory where your source file resides.

For unit-testing we use CppUnit. Usage documentation is located here:
http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/doc/lastest/cppunit_cookbook.html

You need to create a test-fixture for your tests and register it.
See src/testing/example_test.cc and the corresponding entry in
src/testing/CMakeLists.txt for an example.

Afterwards, you can use ctest to run your tests.
