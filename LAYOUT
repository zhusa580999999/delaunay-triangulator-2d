The layout of the tree is as follows:

build: directory for storing built makefiles and objects to; another
       directory may be used, but this one is provided for convenience
src: directory where all source files should be stored
src/public: contains public interfaces and demos on how to call them
src/internal: contains implementation of public interfaces
src/internal/viewers: contains code for viewer tools
src/data: data that may be used with one or more of the targets

TODO(mario): move viewers and other utilities to a special directory
